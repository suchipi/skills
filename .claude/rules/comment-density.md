# Be Sparing With Comments

Don't pile on comments. Every comment draws the reader's eye and makes commented code look more important than the code around it. A long prose comment in front of a one-liner inverts the visual weight of the file.

Default to no comment. Add one only when the **why** is non-obvious - a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant, a workaround for a specific bug. Don't restate what the code does, don't reference the current task or caller, don't summarize a function in front of its declaration.

If you reach for a multi-paragraph comment, that usually means the code needs renaming or restructuring instead.

**Exception: User-facing documentation.** Doc comments on public APIs are user-facing documentation, not internal code commentary. Those should be thorough - describe params, return values, edge cases, and link to related symbols. The "be sparing" rule does NOT apply there.
